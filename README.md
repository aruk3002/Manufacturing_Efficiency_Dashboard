## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **manufacturing production data** and **employee performance metrics** to uncover patterns, highlight inefficiencies, and drive productivity improvements. Built in **Power BI**, the dashboard provides a unified view of how production costs, workforce performance, and training investments influence overall manufacturing efficiency.



## 🎯 Objectives

* Identify trends in **production cost, quantity, and efficiency**.
* Measure the impact of **employee performance and training** on productivity.
* Explore **salary vs. productivity relationships** for strategic workforce planning.
* Provide **data-driven insights** to enhance decision-making.



## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Power BI** – Dashboard development & data visualization
* **DAX** – Advanced calculations & KPIs
* **Power Query** – Data cleaning & transformation
* **Excel** – Data preprocessing & validation



## 📂 Datasets

### 1) Manufacturing Production Data
Fields:
- `ProductID`
- `ProductType`
- `ProductionDate`
- `ProductionCost`
- `CountryOfOrigin`
- `QuantityProduced`
- `WarehouseLocation`

### 2) Employee Performance Metrics
Fields:
- `EmployeeID`
- `Department`
- `HireDate`
- `Salary`
- `CountryOfOperation`
- `ProductID`
- `PerformanceRating`
- `TrainingRecords` *(e.g., hours or count of sessions)*

> ✅ Ensure `ProductID` is a shared key for modeling production ↔ employee relationships where relevant.



## 📈 Key Insights

* 📉 **Cost Efficiency Trends**: Identified fluctuation in production costs across locations and product types.
* 👩‍🏭 **Workforce Productivity**: Training investments strongly correlated with higher performance ratings.
* 💰 **Salary vs. Productivity Gap**: Salary adjustments were reactive, not consistently tied to productivity growth.
* 🌍 **Global Operations View**: Unified dashboard tracking KPIs across multiple countries and departments.



## 📊 Dashboard Features

* Interactive **filters** for products, departments, and countries
* Dynamic **salary vs. productivity analysis**
* Insights on **training effectiveness and performance improvement**
* End-to-end **manufacturing efficiency tracking**






✨ *This dashboard highlights how businesses can bridge the gap between operational costs and workforce efficiency using analytics.*
